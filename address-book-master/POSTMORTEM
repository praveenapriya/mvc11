ADDRESS-BOOK PROJECT POSTMORTEM
April 22, 2010

Successes
- Learned a lot
- Completed project
- Good seperation of concers & encapsulation
- First experience with version control & git
- Familiarization with Qt & SQLite APIs
- Observer pattern to update views

Failures
- Role of controller in MVC pattern.  My AddressBookController class does 
almost nothing. It's just a pass-through to the Model. As the project went 
on I got a better feel for what the controller should be responsible for. 
A lot of logic should be taken out of the QtAddressBookGUI class and pushed
into the controller. TheQtAddressBookGUI class should provide hooks/methods
for the controller to actually control the view's state, rather than doing
most of that within the view itself.

-Planning & Design. I should have spent more time really fleshing out the
program design before hand.


See TODO for additional points to consider.
